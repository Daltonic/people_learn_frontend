# Monthly Project Report (December 2023)

## Progress Update

In December 2023, we made substantial progress, including:

- Translating the Figma design into frontend code using NextJs, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript
- Open-sourcing the frontend code on GitHub and [Vercel](https://sia-people-learn-frontend.vercel.app/)
- Developing 60% of the backend API services using NodeJs and Typescript
- Open-sourcing the backend API services on GitHub

These achievements marked the completion of the frontend development phase and the beginning of the backend integration stage.

## Current Milestone

The team is now focusing on backend code development, adding various endpoints to the existing codebase, and implementing two major services: Payment services and File upload service. These tasks are crucial in streamlining the workload for future milestones.

## Challenges

Challenges faced include maintaining code quality and managing the workload of completing two milestones simultaneously. The team overcame these by sacrificing some leisure time, which allowed for more feature development.

## Next Steps

In January 2024, the team plans to:

- Integrate the developed API endpoints with the frontend
- Add critical services including Payment service, Email service, and Sia Renterd service
